Included here is the first draft of my Soundscape Narrative for ENGCMP0610.
I've just begun to play with the idea of a somewhat vague quarantine soundscape.
The news headlines roll into one another for a passage of time with the pandemic's progression.
I am considering whether to repeat and loop the sounds from my life, or change them each time they reappear.
I will certainly be adding new sounds as well.
