***Soundscape Narrative Reflection***
	The COVID-19 Pandemic and the resulting quarantine orders have been the most prolonged and severe disruption of global daily life, perhaps ever. Statements like these are on the news daily and will be written into the history books. When I am old, people will ask me what it was like to live through such bewildering times. Given the extensive time at home, I have spent long hours thinking about this. I still do not know the answer I will give. Would be more exciting if I tell the stories I have heard of others? Would they listen closer if I embellished on the story of that one weekend this summer I had a high fever? Would they pity me more if I could name people I had lost? I think the most accurate way to tell the story would be the most mundane. The truth is, I, and everyone I knew, simply stayed home. Nothing happened. 
	When I began thinking about what I create for my soundscape narrative, I found it impossible to consider anything but my surroundings. Perhaps their consistency had just ingrained them in my mind over the last 7 months. So, while reflecting on what I had done that day, I listed off: I listened to the news, I made food, I took a shower, I sat at my desk. And it was about all I could come up with each day. My plan was to lay out these sounds in way that the listener would hear them and reflect on their own days (likely deciding theirs were the same). I found the song I chose to accompany the sounds sets the tone very effectively; repetitive and somber.
